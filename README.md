Hello! I'm a 20 years old Brazillian computer science student, just three semesters away from finishing my degree. My pronouns are **she/they**, and I speak Brazillian Portuguese and English. You can reach me on most social medias @bravhelo (though I share all the worst memes)

I've been passionate about computers ever since I can remember, and I love to learn new things â€” I started playing around with C, assembly, some game dev, and Linux when I was in highschool. Lately I've been interested in machine learning, graphical programming, and data integration. My professional goal is to specialize in a field I love (it's very hard to pick just one) and help to build and better tools for people to work with. 

As of now, I'm doing research on ontology based data access, using OWL and SPARQL to semantically query relational databases, and working on a related project. As soon as I have something to show for it, it'll be here :D

### Languages and Tools
